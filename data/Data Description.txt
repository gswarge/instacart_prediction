Data Description
Each entity (customer, product, order, aisle, etc.) has an associated unique id. Most of the files and variable names should be self-explanatory.

orders.csv
This file gives a list of all orders we have in the dataset. 1 row per order. For example, we can see that user 1 has 11 orders, 1 of which is in the train set, and 10 of which are prior orders. The orders.csv doesn’t tell us about which products were ordered. This is contained in the order_products.csv
This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. You are predicting reordered items only for the test set orders. 'order_dow' is the day of week.

order_products_train.csv
This file gives us information about which products (product_id) were ordered. It also contains information of the order (add_to_cart_order) in which the products were put into the cart and information of whether this product is a re-order(1) or not(0).

For example, we see below that order_id 1 had 8 products, 4 of which are reorders.
Still we don’t know what these products are. This information is in the products.csv

The columns present in order_products_train and order_products_prior are same. Then what is the difference between these files.?

In this dataset, 4 to 100 orders of a customer are given and we need to predict the products that will be re-ordered. So the last order of the user has been taken out and divided into train and test sets. All the prior order informations of the customer are present in order_products_prior file. We can also note that there is a column in orders.csv file called eval_set which tells us as to which of the three datasets (prior, train or test) the given row goes to.

Order_products*csv file has more detailed information about the products that been bought in the given order along with the re-ordered status.
